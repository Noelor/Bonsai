Destiny, that well-known son of a bitch, has  other plans. You have a knack for wandering into other peoples’ trouble, and a conscience that won’t let you stay out of it. Whenever thugs are threatening a helpless young widow, you’re there. Whenever criminals become the law, you’re there. There with a great big freaking gun. And if you have to plant a bunch of them in the ground, well, you always warn them not to mess with you. A great choice if you know you’ll be attending game sessions irregularly."
