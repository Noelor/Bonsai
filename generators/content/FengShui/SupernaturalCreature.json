			"Text" : "You are a being from the Underworld, a mystic realm haunted by demons and the spirits of the dead. You are yourself a being that humans would describe as a monster or evil spirit. <br /> <br /> But you are not evil, for even the spawn of the Underworld are capable of exercising free will and doing right instead of wrong. You realize, however, that almost none of your kindred bother to make this effort. They live to terrorize and to inflict pain. You did, too, until you were summoned and dominated by the cruel eunuch sorcerers of the Eaters of the Lotus. At first, you followed their ordersâ€”you had no choice, shackled by mystic bonds. But eventually you were able, through intense mental effort, to break free of their influence. You saw around you people who lived in fear, people whose lives were seen as mere playthings by your Lotus masters. And although most demons would never even think such thoughts, you decided that you would atone for the wrongs you had done, and destroy those who had forced you to do them. <br /> <br /> Supernatural Creatures vary widely in appearance, but all are horrific. Some appear as decomposed human corpses, others as grotesque ogres. Others show no resemblance to the humanoid form. Although you may now fight for the forces of good, your alarming features prevent you from ever passing as a normal member of society."
