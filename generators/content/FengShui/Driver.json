Existential zen, zen, zen. Everyone covets your skills. Fast drivers meet demands in dark places. A vehicle like yours doesnâ€™t pay for itself. So you cross a line or two. Stay cool, cool, cool, you tell yourself. Forget everything else. Just be the road. Who are you fooling? Jacketed inside that cool, bottled within all that control, burns six-twenty horsepower of rage, rage, rage."
