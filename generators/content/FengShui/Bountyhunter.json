You often sign on to hunt criminals who have crossed international borders, or are hiding out in countries without extradition treaties. You always get your quarry, and though you’re not looking for a scrap you take pride in handling a takedown quickly and with minimal fuss. At first, your latest gig seemed like any other. Then your target displayed a depth of resources that didn’t fit the profile. The deeper you dug, the weirder the story got. Still hot on the trail, you have no idea what you are about to plunge into."
