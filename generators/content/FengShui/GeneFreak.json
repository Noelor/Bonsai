			"Text" : "Bizarre energies released by the cataclysmic destruction of a futuristic hyper-Orwellian regime swirled through your world, altering the DNA of hapless survivors. Most died, but a few survived, twisted, traumatized, but able to manifest previously unknown bodily feats. Some energies escaped through poisoned feng shui sites into the present day. Often believing themselves to have been changed by brushes with ordinary radiation or other experiments gone awry, a handful of moderns also acquired credibility-defying super powers. Most gene freaks want to be left alone. Maybe you do, too, but a melodramatic hook prevents it. Or maybe youâ€™ve decided to take an active, heroic part in the Chi War in search of a cure, or to show that some cursed with unwanted might can wield it with responsibility and discipline."
