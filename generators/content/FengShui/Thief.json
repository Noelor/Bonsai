			"Text" : "You are a master thief. Although you make your living taking things from their legal owners, you don’t do so primarily for the money. Sure, you live in luxury from the proceeds of your past misdeeds. But it’s the challenge that keeps your senses keen and your ambitions sharp. You operate through careful research, by assembling every available scrap of information about your target. When you go in, you have every angle planned out to the millisecond. You also plan for something to go wrong. That’s when the adrenaline kicks in, when you have to think fast and get it right the first time. When the alarms are screaming and the footfalls of heavily-armed guards are rushing your way, when the distance to your getaway vehicle seems impossibly vast in the moments you have left to you—that’s the moment you live for. The money is just gravy. Still, there’s a thought nagging at the back of your skull that maybe all of this thrill-seeking is just a little bit meaningless—maybe even adolescent. Lately you’ve been thinking about leaving a positive mark on the world. Robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, or something like that. Is there a way to use your skills for the greater good?"
