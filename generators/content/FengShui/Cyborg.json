Recovered by radiation-addled members of the Jammer cult, you begged for a merciful demise. Instead they tried to save you, using their bizarre scrounged technology. You returned to consciousness both better and worse than before, an amalgam of mangled humanity and barely operational robotic prosthetics. Impelled onward by a cranial chip that won’t let you kill yourself, you plunge into the Chi War in search of a cure for your freakish condition—or maybe just the oblivion destiny continues to withhold from you."
