			"Text" : "The Maverick Cop is a plainclothes detective assigned to a major crime unit of a big city. You may work undercover, you may be in an anti-mob unit, or you may be a homicide detective. Good-looking but slovenly, you may cultivate a drinking problem and definitely have a personal life in a state of serious disorder. Despite the fact that you are one yourself, you’ve always had a problem with authority figures. You see yourself as a loner, but this may date back only as far as your last partner getting killed, or the origin point of some other melodramatic hook. You are always on the verge of being fired and are often on suspension. You keep your job only because your gruff superior officer has a secret soft spot for you, and because you get results. Although you always get the job done in the end, everything seems to conspire to make you look bad. People connected to your investigations have a habit of getting killed. Witnesses get snuffed. Bystanders fall like tenpins whenever you take part in a firefight. Most of all, you never seem to be able to just apprehend a crook. It’s not like you deliberately set out to empty the contents of your high-caliber revolver into each and every scumbag you’re supposed to arrest. You warn them even, tell them they shouldn’t be feeling lucky, shouldn’t ever get you riled. Punks never  earn."
