			"Text" : "As a devil-may-care hang-glider on the winds of fate, you’ve turned natural luck and a flair for getting yourself out of scrapes and into a profitable career. You’ve learned to handle yourself in a fight—not all losers are good sports, after all. But mostly you rely on your drop-dead gorgeous smile and your airtight instincts to keep yourself out of trouble. With these two weapons at your disposal, you’ve carved out a life of luxury for yourself—no pleasure is too flashy or shallow for your tastes. You came from humble beginnings and made your fortune using only your brains and your need for victory. The latest clothes, the shiniest gadgets: these are things you’ve dreamed of since childhood. But the real prize is the sheer joy of beating the odds, of triumphing over your opponents when logic decrees that you should be down for the count. Now a melodramatic hook pulls you into the Chi War, a situation where all of the odds you’ve memorized are turned upside down. Nonetheless, you face this new adventure with a grin and a heaping helping of aplomb. You know it won’t take you long to figure the angles."
