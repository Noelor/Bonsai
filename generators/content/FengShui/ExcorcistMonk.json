			"Text" : "Few know this, but the Chi War began when impudent beings from the spirit world entered the world of man and began to interfere with it. Thus began the great imbalance that granted geomantic power to rascals and men of violence, and opened up ruptures between time periods. For the world to return to peace, enabling people to once again pursue enlightenment through detachment, the spirits must be sent back where they belong. You, a wise and therefore powerful monk, have descended from the serenity of your mountain monastery to perform the necessary exorcisms. Though you’ll not turn a blind eye to other evils, none of them can be truly vanquished until your central task is done. Before choosing this archetype, check with your GM to make sure you’ll be encountering enough magic opponents to make it fun."
