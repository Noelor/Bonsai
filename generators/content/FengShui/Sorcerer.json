			"Text" : "You are a master of the occult arts, studied in the ancient techniques of channeling and transforming chi energy into a supernatural force, bent by your will. Some say this corrupts chi energy into what it was not meant to be. You call those people fools.<br /> <br /> Although there are many ways to do harm to an opponent, none has quite the awe-inspiring effect of an energy bolt cast from a magician’s hand. You have some trouble manifesting your great powers in later junctures, such as our own and 1850, where the chi flow has been suppressed. But in other junctures, you access your unearthly abilities without impediment. However, in most places superstitious cretins assume that all sorcerers pursue sinister ends. True, most who follow the ways of the occult wind up doing great harm to the people. They have been corrupted by exposure to the Underworld, the home of demons and evil spirits. Or perhaps they have been seduced by their own lust for power. But that does not describe you! You have the will to resist, where weaker minds failed. Given the bad reputation  of sorcerers, you have learned to keep your mystic abilities hidden as you fight for the right side of the Chi War.<br /> <br /> Along with the sorcerer’s versatility comes some additional complexity. You will want to own a copy of the book to play it to the fullest."
