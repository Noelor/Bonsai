			"Text" : "Afghanistan. Iraq. Places you still aren’t allowed to name. A former member of an elite force trained in counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, and sabotage missions, you had a hard-bitten military mindset drilled into you along with your extensive list of deadly skills. It is possible that you were dishonorably discharged from your beloved unit, fairly or otherwise; this might be your melodramatic hook. People keep expecting you to relax, to kick back, to get along, just like everybody else. But you can’t. Your nerves are still on edge. Whenever you get into a fender bender, or a confrontation on the street, it takes all of your determination not to leap on the guy harassing you and beat him to a pulp. You long for a new cause to believe in, one you can feel as much fervor for as your old corps. Most of all, you want the pure rush you get from combat. There’s nothing you’d like more than to feel the taste of blood and fear in your mouth on another battlefield. If that battlefield involves a fight for justice and freedom against tyrants from across the timestream, so much the better."
