			"Text" : "Nobody starts out wanting to be a bandit. You began life as a farmer, craftsman, or merchant. Then disaster struck. A flood destroyed your farm. Imperial taxes drove you into poverty. Perhaps you were the victim of other bandits. In any case, you turned your back on society. You began to live off what you could steal. With guile and determination, you turned survival into not only a way of life, but also a source of inspiration for others. What life dished out to you, you took, and converted into power. Other bandits now flock to you. Imperial soldiers hunt you. Merchants shudder whenever your name is spoken. And yet, you find yourself returning to the very society that you once abandoned. Something draws you there — something you wish to fight for — something you must defend. You have taken the first few steps on a new road. It leads either to redemption, or to death."
