			"Text" : "If you hail from the Past Juncture, you may be an actual member of the legendary Japanese secret society of assassins. But in Feng Shui 2 the term “Ninja” is also used generically to describe any operative who specializes in stealth and penetration missions. Although capable of holding your own during a fight,you prefer deception and surprise over a frontal assault. Ninjas maintain a mystique around themselves, often pretending to have secret mystical powers. Although the Ninja does have a passing acquaintance with esoteric chi abilities, the mystery surrounding you is mostly due to your own wit and presence. It is not fame that you crave so much as cultivating that mystique. You wish your deeds to be famous, but your identity to be a secret. You want to be feared. You want to be whispered about. Nothing amuses you more than to stand among people who have no clue just how quick and deadly you are. But lately, you have begun to feel a sense of emptiness. Maybe you have suffered a loss in love, or some other personal blow that has made you feel less invincible than usual. Perhaps you’ve begun to question your amoral existence. When you discover the Chi War, you are pulled in either by your melodramatic hook, or by the awakening of a desire to do something—to leave a mark on the world, even if no one will ever know your name."
