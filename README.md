Bonsai
---

Bonsai is an attempt at creating a webpage based random text generator. It can be used for making lists of random names too highly complex nested entries. By externalizing the actual data to seperate json files re-using parts becomes easy and effcient. 

Bonsai works entirely through client side javascript and relies ony on jquery. You can see a live version of Bonsai doing its thing [here](http://xesyto.github.io/Bonsai/).
